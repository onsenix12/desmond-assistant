- **Visual busyness** indicators provide instant insights
- **Proactive conflict detection** prevents issues

### Decision Fatigue Reduction
Every interaction is designed to minimize cognitive load:
- **All options visible** simultaneously (no scrolling)
- **One-click actions** for common tasks
- **Pre-written messages** for communications
- **Pattern-based predictions** for smarter suggestions

### Mobile-First Design
The interface works seamlessly across devices:
- **Touch-optimized** controls
- **Responsive layouts** that adapt to screen size
- **Mobile-specific features** like bottom navigation
- **Consistent experience** across platforms
